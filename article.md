As a newly converted Rustacean, I wanted to port one of my favorite projects to explore the language.

The project is an obstacle avoiding robot. Very easy in Arduino and it allows to get a better feel for the Rust language by implementing structures.

_This article and this car would DEFINITELY not have been possible without the help of Rahix, [who created avr-hal](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal), and the [Rust Embedded working group](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg)._ Lots of Love to them üíå. Also, [the Rust forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/) is home to many amazing people who will also help you.

### Using AVR-hal üì¶

Arduino runs on [AVR microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers) and luckily, the avr-hal project has you covered for most of the popular AVR-MCUs.

Choose your board, and go run one of the üòâüí°-[blinkin led super easy examples](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/master/boards/arduino-uno/examples/uno-blink.rs) to get a feel for it. As easy as Arduino, but in Rust. How cool is that?

### Using avrdude

You will need to [install avr-gcc](https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-avr) to compile Rust code for AVR. Then you will need avrdude üë®üèΩ‚Äçüîß to program the MCU, that is, loading the compiled program into on-chip flash memory.

Check if you have the command line developer tools with : ¬¥xcode-select --install`Run and install the lattest version of avr-gcc with:`brew tap osx-cross/avr``brew install avr-gcc`

You can now brew [install avrdude](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_1.html) (DownloaderUploader) which is the program who will communicate with your MCU.

You will also need [Rust nightly](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.2.0/book/nightly-rust.html) to work with AVR, so this is a good idea to `rustup override set nightly` in the repository.

### Get in the car!

I listed all the hardware you will need in my repository, but really, any generic electronic you have (distance sensor, servo and motors) will do. If it's a first project, go with a kit available on Ebay, Banggood or Amazon (linked in my repo).

You can communicate with your board via avrdude with a script (also details also in the repo:). I also commented the hell out of the code - and if you have questions, just reach out! What I don't know, we will figure out together with the Rust Embedded group if necessary!

I will just go through the important parts in the different modules.

#### main.rs

This is a Rust nightly, no-std Rust project, which means it will not use the standard library. You need to indicate to your program the entry point.`#[arduino_uno::entry]`. The standard library is not available on embedded platforms at all because it require because it requires an operating system.

Then with avr-hal, you will access to all peripherals of your MCU:

```
let dp = arduino_uno::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
```

... and collapse the ports:

```
let mut pins = arduino_uno::Pins::new(dp.PORTB, dp.PORTC, dp.PORTD);
```

The serial is needed only for testing your vehicle on your overloaded table.

You will need two timers. The first one (timer1) will be used to work with the sensor unit. The timer needs to be prescaled because the internal clock is 16Mhz. You probably remember from middle school that period and frequency are interdependent

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large T\=\frac{1}{f}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large T \= \frac{1}{16e6} \text{ (number of counts)} \times 2^{16} \text{  (size of the timer register)} \= 0.00409s">

that is 4 ms before the timer overflows. That is pretty useless. By prescaling frequency you allow more manageable cycles:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \frac{1}{(\frac{16Mhz}{64})} \text{ ‚âà } 0.263 s">


It means that after 260 ms the timer will overflow and restart from zero. To read the timer, we just need to read the number of counts it is at.
For example, to get 100ms, which is a good time to send a new echo wave, we do $$  \frac{100ms}{260ms} * 2^{16} ‚âà 25000$$. So when we are at 25000 counts we know that 100 ms have passed.

```
let timer1 = dp.TC1;
timer1.tccr1b.write(|w| w.cs1().prescale_64());

```

Timer2 is initialized as well (more in servo part!)

As per the docs, [timers are hardwired to some pins](https://rahix.github.io/avr-hal/arduino_uno/pwm/index.html). This means that to rotate a servo motor, you need to be careful with declaring the corresponding pin. Then it is only a matter to setting duty of the right pin.

Next, assign the pins you will use for your wheels, and the rest consists in drawing the rotation loop. The pins can be [downgraded to allow the wheels to be used in an array](https://rahix.github.io/avr-hal/atmega328p_hal/port/portd/struct.PD3.html#method.downgrade).

- to get the type of a variable in Rust, you can always type a line with an incorrect type, `let x :() = wheels`, and the compiler will refuse to compile and provide you the right type

```
--> src/main.rs:106:15
   |
106 |     let x:()= wheels;
   |           --  ^^^^^^ expected `()`, found array of 4 elements
   |           |
   |           expected due to this
   |
   = note: expected unit type `()`
                  found array `[arduino_uno::atmega328p_hal::port::Pin<arduino_uno::atmega328p_hal::port::mode::Output>; 4]`
```

- at this point of time, the compiler will give this information. Please note that this is not arduino_uno::atmega328p_hal but arduino_uno::hal

#### motors.rs

In that module, (that we need to import to the main), we are importing the wheels array `&mut [arduino_uno::hal::port::Pin<arduino_uno::hal::port::mode::Output>; 4]` and destructuring the wheels.

```

pub fn go_forward<>(wheels: &mut [arduino_uno::hal::port::Pin<arduino_uno::hal::port::mode::Output>; 4]) {
    // Be careful here with the order of unpacking. In my case, pin 4 is connected to left forward, 5 to left backwards, etc
    let [left_forw, left_back, right_forw, right_back] = wheels;

```

and setting wheels in motion. You might need to adjust the constants for the right times for your project (and the state of your batteries!) A lot can happen with tired batteries and frictionous floors. Or not.

### servo

Here, we are simply assigning duty cycles according to the data sheet for SG90 sensor.

Timer2, which is going to be used for the servo motor (the little rotating head), needs to be prescaled even more. Why? Most servo motors need a frequency of 50Hz and short duty cycles to control its speed (which will result in a rotation). Duty cycles are nothing mystical, it is [the fraction of the period wehre the signal is high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_cycle) you give to your motor, to control its rotation.

Please note, that while timer1 is a 16bit counter, timer2 is a 8 bit counter! That means that for our calculation, and according to the datasheet for the servo motor:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \frac{1}{(16Mhz/1024)} \times 2^{8} \text{ ‚âà }0.016s">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large  \frac{1}{(0.016s)} \text{ ‚âà } 61 Hz">

So, 16 ms, 60 hz approximately.

```
// in main module
let mut timer2 = pwm::Timer2Pwm::new(dp.TC2, pwm::Prescaler::Prescale1024);
let mut pd3 = pins.d3.into_output(&mut pins.ddr).into_pwm(&mut timer2);
```

When rotating the motor, we are not reading but writing to a special register OCR (output compare register). But avr-hal protects us from all this low level scariness, and you just write the number of counts you need to rotate your servo right.
The duty cycle that those servos need are between 1 and 2ms. To center the servo for example, you need:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \frac{1.5}{16} \text{ms} \times 2^{8} \text{ ‚âà } 24 \text{counts}">

### sensor

For the sensor, I made a sensor-unit struct that is filled in main. Here this is only a question of setting the trigger high, and low again.
We start it by writing to its timer counter register (tcnt1):

```rust
sensor_unit.timer.tcnt1.write(|w| unsafe { w.bits(0) });
```

We then set it high for 10 us.

```
sensor_unit.trig.set_high().void_unwrap();
delay.delay_us(TRIGGER_UP_TIME);
sensor_unit.trig.set_low().void_unwrap();
```

We make a sanity check to continue if the sensor does not detect anything:

```
'outer: while sensor_unit.echo.is_low().void_unwrap() {
// if more than 200 ms ( = 50000) we might have not detected anything and can continue.
   if sensor_unit.timer.tcnt1.read().bits() >= 65000 {
      continue 'outer;
   }
}
```

and last, we measure the echo by waiting for it to go low again.

```
while sensor_unit.echo.is_high().void_unwrap() {}
```

That's it.
I would recommend to pay special attention to avr-hal instructions for starting your project. To make sure your whole system is grounded as per the schematics. For the rest, good luck and you can always come and find us if you need anything!
